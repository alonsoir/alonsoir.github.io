About Me

A software engineer, eternal learner, melessly curious. I love science, all of them, but particularly particle physics, astrophysics and everything related to how to use technology to improve people's health, quality of life and produc vity.

I also love arts and ar st from reinassance movement, DaVinci, Michellangelo, Rafael, of course Goya, Velazquez, El Greco, Tiziano, representatives of the impressionist movement, such as Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Degas. Of those who are alive I like Antonio Lopez very much.

I have dreams to fulfill, to be able to work one day at CERN in Geneva contributing in some particle physics experiment. Another dream is to be able to work at the ESA trying to find habitable exoplanets, to work helping to create a system of recommenda ons so that medical specialists can quickly find a diagnosis to diseases and finally I would like one day to create a founda on to help train the new genera on of engineers from their earliest childhood, learning to design hardware and so ware while they play.
