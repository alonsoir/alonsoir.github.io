WORK EXPERIENCE

  *01/10/2022 - 01/06/2023

    Software Architect/Operations Architect at Ericsson, Malaga

    I worked as a software and operations architect for Ericsson's Cognitive Software project, participating in the maintenance of all current architecture built with J2EE 8, .NET, bash, Apache Spark 2.3.5, Apache Impala, Spring 2.7.x, postgres , MariaDB, parquet files, pipeline maintenance with Bitbucket, Jenkins, Docker compose and Ansible on premise machines with hypervisor, with Centos7 as host OS and docker compose running on top. We also use Ambari to manage the HDFS/Spark cluster, Hue for the data part in Impala, and Heidi for the SQL clusters. Kibana to review the architecture logs in our environments. I gave support to both the production teams that use Ericsson software, created new features of the project, and corrective maintenance on the different components of the entire architecture, as well as maintaining the operational documentation of the different components.

    I also participated in making peer reviews of the pull requests of the colleagues and in mentoring the younger teammates to teach good development practices, all based on TDD practices first, refactor later, test again, practice pair programming as long as it could be done. The work environment was on Windows 10 and Centos7 machines running on virtual machines, in an international environment with Spanish, Indian and Hungarian colleagues.

    I also helped and participated in multiple meetings to help define the new architecture that will use deep learning components built with Python.

    I helped to improve the DevSecOps strategy for this architecture, proposing improvements, from that improvement came the evaluation of an open source component to analyze the code of the projects hosted in BitBucket and that it automatically proposes pull requests so that we can evaluate it and thus reduce debt technique.

    Something similar to Snyk but open source. After that evaluation, we understood that BitBucket must have this feature in its technology stack, so for the new architecture we will be migrating to GitHub because of this very important feature.

    I also evaluated how to create distroless containers in order to reduce the size and possible attack vector of microservices managed by docker containers.

  * October 2020 – March 2021
    Lead software engineer at ING Direct, Madrid
      I led a development team for ING Direct to build a financial transaction recommendation engine to prevent tax fraud. I participated in the development of a plugin using Apache Spark with scala, Apache Kafka with java and JPGPJ/Bouncy Castle (both languages).
I built a microservice based on hexagonal architecture with java8 that made intensive use of Kafka to publish encrypted events using JPGPJ. The spark plugin basically had to periodically launch SQL queries to create a Dataframe, create a symmetrically encrypted csv file with JPGPJ, and finally copy it from the HDFS to an FTP. The files had to be generated by the difference with respect to the previous day.
I worked every day with the ING architecture team proposing solutions and ideas, as well as with the Big Data team, which I supported in specific efforts. I helped senior managers in the bank to understand what we were doing, I made sure my colleagues were following the right way to build technology.

  * September 2017 – January 2020
    SOFTWARE ARCHITECT/DATA ENGINEER at Stratio, Madrid
      I participate in the design and development of a project to NCOI (NCOI Opleidingen, @NCOIopleidingen), designing and developing a scalable microservices architecture to be able to perform Extract Transform and load data from differents sources using json, csv, txt files and external normalized databases. These data are used by a referral system so that college students get the best possible referral based on what the college knows about them.
The idea is to design a scalable distributed architecture of data consumption following the CQRS pattern, Command Query Responsibility Segregation, so that following this pattern, I can segregate the writes and readings in a distributed system so that the writes go to a cluster of data independent of the other cluster of data readings.
Together with the use and implementation of an architecture based on microservices dockerized and managed with Mesos following the Orchestrator pattern to manage the distributed transactionality inherent to each of the microservices together with a series of steps based on classification algorithms (machine learning), my colleagues and me built this architecture to give the best possible recommendations to the students of the university.
I was in charge of designing and implementing the distributed architecture and my fellow data scientists in the selection of deep learning algorithms and implementation of the different phases for classification.
I am using java, spring-boot, spring-cloud technologies like Eureka, Ribbon, Feign, docker, mesos, kafka,and a distributed postgresql port develop by Stratio.

  * July 2019 – January 2020
    SOFTWARE ARCHITECT/DATA ENGINEER at Stratio, Madrid
      in my spare time or while we were waiting for another provider to finish their part while we developed for NCOI working for Stratio, i developed some open source projects.
An scalable event-oriented recommendation engines based on apache spark deep learning algorithms, using kafka as an event engine, mongodb as a persistence engine, written in scala and published in GitHub. I started a time ago, with the advice of my fellow data scientist from Stratio, I've given it a few tweaks. https://github.com/alonsoir/awesome-recommendation-engine
A proof of concept designed to detect and classify variable stars in stellar images taken by radio telescopes. This type of stars allows you to create a map to create routes in interstellar space.
https://github.com/alonsoir/demo-dl4j
I have also been researching the use of api deeplearning4j for facial recognition. https://github.com/alonsoir/demoFaceRecognition
A scalable orchestration-based microservice architecture in order to periodically interrogate the bitcoin quote and make it available for multiple outside requests. I used java, spring-boot, kafka, elastic-search and docker. https://github.com/alonsoir/demo-kafka-elastic https://github.com/alonsoir/demo-quartz
Also I have been working during the end of the year on a project to try to find out the numbers of the euromillions and the primitive, with little success but very useful because it has allowed me to practice with the functional style of the api stream that appeared with the jdk8.
I have participated in the review of a book on Kafka-Streams of the Pack Publishing house, both the text and the code. Https://github.com/alonsoir/KafkaStreaming.

  * November 2016 – May 2017
    BIG DATA ENGINEER at Keedio, Madrid
      I have participated in the development and integration of a lambda architecture created for Banco Santander in order to apply a solution imposed by the central banks to these systemic banks too big to fall, Basilea 4.
The idea is to process multiple sources of unstructured data To finally arrive at a calculation of the credit risk of the bank Santander. For this we need the use of a series of components, such as Apache Flume and Apacha Kafka for the raw data intake in avro format in the landing zone of the data lake, then we have a series of engines in charge of the consolidation of the avro files in other format, parquet, which would then be exploited in the form of Hive tables in the integration with the company that is responsible for the exploitation of architecture, enrichment engines, user view creation engines that are also used for a Last phase where we finally create an excel file.
The technologies used are scala as first language, some of java, hadoop, cloudera, spark, kafka, flume, shell scripts.
My concrete participation in this project was to create a utility to create files parquets, validation, correction in case of error, parts of the api, as a set of works spark to validate quantitatively and qualitatively the architecture delivered, In other words, a method to check that the software is correct, doing the calculations correctly, applying mechanisms designed by the bank, using scala.
I develop too the part of api responsible for making necessary currency conversion, since the solution delivered is designed to be executed generically for all delegations of the Santander bank in the world, sixteen today.
Finally I was also in charge of integrating the software in the place of exploitation chosen by the Bank.

  * February 2016 – November 2016
    BIG DATA ENGINEER at Freelance, Badajoz
      I have been studying and doing various training courses, like learning scala more seriously with BigDataUniversity, machine learning with Professor Andrew Ng and Apache Spark and hadoop architectures using a formacionhadoop.com course. As a result of that training I have written a couple of projects hosted on github to treat tweets in near real time using apache kafka, apache spark and some nosql databases like mongodb and Cassandra and another project about how to implement machine learning algorithms (ALS) for a recommendation engine. This project uses Apache hadoop and Apache Kafka and apache Spark, both projects are developed using the Scala language.

REVIEWER
  * TEXT AND CODE REVIEWER OF A BOOK ON KAFKA STREAM FOR PACKT PUBLISHING. PENDING RELEASE., Badajoz, October 2019 – January 2020

     I reviewed the code and text of some chapters on how to stream with Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming, as well as KafkaStreams. I added notes, improved the text, fixed the source code among other tasks. Very instructive task, I loved it.
